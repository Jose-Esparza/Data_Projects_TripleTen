# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

## Project Description
This project represents one of my first data science projects, focused on practicing fundamental data cleaning and exploratory data analysis techniques using Instacart's grocery delivery dataset.

## Introduction
**Objective:** To practice and develop core data science skills including data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis using real-world e-commerce data.

**Goals:**
- Learn data cleaning techniques with messy, real-world data
- Practice pandas operations and data manipulation
- Develop skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand customer purchasing patterns through data exploration

## Methodology
**What was done:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of multiple datasets
- Exploratory data analysis of customer ordering patterns
- Data visualization to understand shopping behaviors
- Practice with merging and manipulating large datasets

**How it was accomplished:**
- Used pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
- Applied various data cleaning techniques (handling missing values, duplicates, data types)
- Created visualizations to explore customer behavior patterns
- Practiced joining multiple datasets together
